# Local Map Project
An interactive map that uses Knockout.js, jQuery, and third party APIs (Google Maps and Flickr) to show the best local food places.

## Using the map
Select (by marking with an [X]) the meals (Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner) you want. The map will display the
restaurants that offer those meals. Click on a restaurant name on the list or in the map pin to view the location 
and images of the food of that restaurant. 
 
## View the Local Map Application
Open the local map web application [here](https://miguelamartinez.github.io/local-map/).
Alternatively, download the application files and open the `index.html` file.
