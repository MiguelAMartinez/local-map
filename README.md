# Local Map Project
This interactive neighborhood map uses JS Knockout, Google maps, and third party APIs to show the best 
restaurants in Austin.

## Using the map
Select (by marking with an [X]) the meals (Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner) you want. The map will display the
restaurants that offer those meals. Click on a restaurant name on the list or in the map pin to view the location 
and images of the food of that restaurant.
